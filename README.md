This is a silly little program.

All it does is take two numbers (one from a slide, one from a input/arrow), 
and gives a choice of four mathematical operations (addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and exponential), and gives the result.

Yes, it is silly.

On the other hand, it is just to demonstrate that using R, Shiny, the the
Shinyserver is possible, and relatively easy.
